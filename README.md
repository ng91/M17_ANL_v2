## Schematic
Diagram was not tested yet.
However, schematic and PCB layout is still work in progress.
First prototyped manufactured - firmware writing is still in progress.

## Technical details

M17_ANL_v2 is a radio modem designed especially to support interaction with existing M17 capable radio terminals & repeaters. It also means packet acquisition, for debugging cases or sniffing, just for fun idk.
However M17_ANL_v2 can be used to receive and transmit raw digital data - it's by design protocol agnostic. 

### Parameters

* Operating freqency range is 420MHz to 450MHz (M17 operates within amateur frequency band 430-440MHz) - after a few changes of RF elements values also another frequency bands
* Modulation schemes selectable - 2FSK, 3FSK, 4FSK, MSK and FM (for M17 - 4FSK)
* Output power level is set from -16dbm up to 10dbm (in 0.3125 dB steps)
* Data rate is set from 0.05 up to 25 kbps (for M17 - 9600 bps)
* IF filter bandwidth selectable - 12.5 kHz, 18.75 kHz, or 25 kHz
* Configuration, transmit and receive by AT commands - over USB-CDC
* All registers of ADF7021 also configurable by manual mode
* Additional 4 GPIOs - first pair can be used as I2C interface, second can be UART
* Four different colour LEDs - PWR, SYS, RX and TX - indicate the state of the device
* Programmable by SWD interface

### Most important ICs used in project

* STM32F303CBT6 - MCU which controls data flow(PC <-> RF TRX), and radio parameters.
* ADF7021 - radio transceiver.
